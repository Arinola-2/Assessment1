        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Fashola Arinola Karimat, and I'm thrilled to share my journey of transitioning into
             the tech industry. My academic background began with a National Diploma in Hospitality Management from
              LASPOTECH. After completing my diploma, I decided to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science 
              at the National Open University.
            Interestingly, my career in the Lagos State Ministry began early in the year, even before I obtained my
             educational qualifications. I was employed with my SSCE certificate, and my initial role was quite
              different from what I'm doing today. However, as I progressed in my career, I started to develop an 
              interest in the tech industry.Before I knew it, I was nominated for the She Code training program.
             Initially, I was hesitant due to my fear of coding and programming languages. However, I decided
              to take the leap and enroll in the program.
            I'm glad I made the decision to pursue the She Code Africa training.
             It's been an eye-opening experience, and I'm excited to continue learning and growing in the 
             tech space.My goal is to become a proficient coder and contribute meaningfully to the tech industry.</p>
